    <br><p>Hi Friends,<br><br>
        My name is Lydia Damoose, and I am a sophomore Visual Communications Design and Sociology Double Major here at the University of Notre Dame. I have two brothers (one of which is shown in the picture above) and one sister. I live in Harbor Springs, Michigan, but here on campus, I live in Pasquerilla West Hall (Peace, Love, PDub)!<br><br> I am a member of the Notre Dame Band Program, playing the sousaphone (tuba) in the Marching Band, Saxophone in the Hockey Pep Band, and trumpet in the University Concert Band. Being a member of the band, I have been able to utilize my design skills by designing band apparel and creating flyers for various concerts and festivals, gain inspiration through music, and meet new students who shift my ideas and give constructive criticism of my projects.<br><br>Beyond band, though, in order to gain more skills in my potential occupational field, this summer, I am participating in an internship with the Notre Dame Development Office. My internship position is creating videos and booklets to tell the Notre Dame Story. This will give me much experience with cinematography and inDesign, allowing me to grow in my design skills, as well as learn about people and grow in my sociological insight. This internship will hopefully allow me to see where I am supposed to take my future, whether it be in fundraising, nonprofit work, teaching with the ACE Program, or utilizing my design and sociology skills in some other unknown way.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to check out my website, and God Bless you!</p>
