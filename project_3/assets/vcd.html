    <p>For this project, we were told to take a picture and recreate it with adjectives to describe it. At this time, I was very into Froot Loops, and I love its many colors, so I took on the task of recreating a Froot Loop out of text. This project was very challenging, but in the end, I think it was fairly successful. I ultimately took a picture, found each color through Adobe Illustrator, and then added text in the colors that I had found in Illustrator.</p>

    <p>For my next series, I decided to selected another series that we completed in VCD 01 where we were told to depict the phrase 'Racism Destroys Societies.' For my design, I ultimately decided to focus on patriotism and the broken America because of racism. This series is the process that I took of designing four images, narrowing it down and editing to one, and then revising that one after receiving much feedback to create my final image.</p>
