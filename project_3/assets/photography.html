    <p>These photographs come from my Portrait Series that I did for my Photography I class. Each of the images represent the personalities of the models. The shirtless cowboy image is even in the process of being sold to a local artist who focuses on gender roles and masculinity. </p>

    <p>In this series, I combine food coloring and water to document the spontaneity and randomness seconds after dropping food coloring into a bowl of water. My idea for this project was initially sparked by the desire to portray the chaos in a human's brain when one has a mental illness. </p>
